Since messages are digitally signed, users only need to care about the message signer and not who relayed it or whose index it was found from.\n*\n* signer is the entity that verified its origin. In other words: message author and signer can be different entities, and only the signer needs to use Iris.\n*\n* For example, a crawler can import and sign other people's messages from Twitter. Only the users who trust the crawler will see the messages.\n*\n* \"Rating\" type messages, when added to an SocialNetwork, can add or remove Identities from the web of trust. Verification/unverification messages can add or remove Attributes from an Contact. Other types of messages such as social media \"post\" are just indexed by their author, recipient and time.\n*\n* Constructor: creates a message from the param obj.signedData that must contain at least the mandatory fields: author, recipient, type and time.

Unfortunately, we ran into a bunch of catastrophic backtracking issues \n * with certain input text, causing Autolinker to either hang or just take a \n * really long time to parse the string.\n *\n * The current code is intended to be a O(n) algorithm that walks through\n * the string in one pass, and tries to be as cheap as possible. We don't need\n * to implement the full HTML spec, but rather simply determine where the string\n * looks like an HTML tag, and where it looks like text (so that we can autolink\n * that).\n * \n * This state machine parser is intended just to be a simple but performant\n * parser of HTML for the subset of requirements we have. We simply need to:\n *\n * 1. Determine where HTML tags are\n * 2. Determine the tag name (Autolinker specifically only cares about <a>,\n *    <script>, and <style> tags, so as not to link any text within them)\n *\n * We don't need to:\n *\n * 1. Create a parse tree\n * 2. Auto-close tags with invalid markup\n * 3. etc.\n * \n * The other intention behind this is that we didn't want to add external \n * dependencies on the Autolinker utility which would increase its size. For \n * instance, adding htmlparser2 adds 125kb to the minified output file,\n * increasing its final size from 47kb to 172kb (at the time of writing). It \n * also doesn't work exactly correctly, treating the string \"<3 blah blah blah\"\n * as an HTML tag.\n * \n * Reference for HTML spec: \n * \n *     https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/syntax.html#sec-tokenization\n *\n * @param {String} html The HTML to parse\n * @param {Object} callbacks\n * @param {Function} callbacks.onOpenTag Callback function to call when an open\n *   tag is parsed.

using a fast, naive layout algorithm that stacks images in order until the viewport has been filled.\n *    After measurement is complete (componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate) this component evaluates positioned cells\n *    in order to determine if another measurement pass is required (eg if actual cell sizes were less than estimated sizes).\n *    All measurements are permanently cached (keyed by `keyMapper`) for performance purposes.\n * 2) Second pass uses the external `cellPositioner` to layout cells.\n *    At this time the positioner has access to cached size measurements for all cells.\n *    The positions it returns are cached by Masonry for fast access later.\n *    Phase one is repeated if the user scrolls beyond the current layout's bounds.\n *    If the layout is invalidated due to eg a resize, cached positions can be cleared using `recomputeCellPositions()`.\n *\n * Animation constraints:\n *   Simple animations are supported (eg translate/slide into place on
